============Tshark captures to JSON converting==================
_ Have a raw Tshark capture (.TEXT), remember the name (exp. Node1.txt). Put it in the same folder as the filter script.
_ go into Basic filter folder, run the Packet_analyzer.py (python3 packet_analyzer.py) (Suggested and re-engineered from Professor Erik Golen, Advanced OOP course)
_ check the new file Node1_filtered.txt ( the columns should be seperated nicely)
_ move it to Tshark filter folder
_ Run the jsoncon.py script (JSON conversion script), this will convert the filtered Tshark into a json format (python3 jsoncon.py)
# THIS STEP IS VITAL: Make sure to use Python3 on the conversion script, as well as open the tshark.json file and DELETE THE LAST TIME.
# The script is not optimized, for every entry it will add a new line, which is fine but the last one is also added, therefore, it needs to be deleted.
_ Bring the file to the iottest folder for upload


============Uploading data to AWS IoT Core process===================

The process of installing boto3 is seperated, it will not be explained or guided.
_ Main commands to active boto3 for uploading data:
cd boto3
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .

python -m pip install boto3

_ after running ". venv/bin/activate", change cd to iottest, run the upload_raw_aus.py (with python3) "python3 upload_raw_aus.py < Tshark.json"
#It can takes a while (up to 5 mins) however, I tried to use "aws configure" and all Enter to somewhat refresh the credentials? it worked but not consistent.

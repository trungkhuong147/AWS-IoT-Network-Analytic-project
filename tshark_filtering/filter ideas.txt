_ total of destinations / sources/ protocols
_ The amount of times that a source/ destination was detinated (Which one has the highest traffic)
_ MAC filtering (NOT POSSIBLE SINCE THERE IS NO MAC FIELD IN THE DATASET), how many IP is associated with 1 MAC address (DHCP could be an issue) but what if a device is statically designed.

_ total bytes sent by sources / received by destinations (to figuring out the heavy traffic nodes in the network)
_ Filtering by locations / sites (might not be feasiable)

_ Enable a detail statistic for a specific address (might include total % of traffic compared to everything, packet size, amount...), and then project the possible outcomes
_ Compared 2 IPs to one another for better info.

===The alogirthim for BOT NET behaviors detection (Based on the information gathered in the dataset)===

_ a specific IP source that has the most packet sent. (Or enter an IP)
_ abnormal protocol of a packet detected compared to the whole network. (port > 1024) (Network failure types packets because they have long durations, overlooked, more than 50% of total)
_ Average "small length" and "constant" of the IP compared to the whole average. (according to [11] smaller size is better to maintain the connection between the hosts, < 400 bytes)
_ TCP or UDP data processing [11], there might be a pattern in the packet's data
_ Time element, is it during rush hour?
_ It is a server node (?)

===== NETWORK ANALYTIC==========
_ Correlation: 
host ip has most tcp send (by source) is normally a server node.
IP with the most traffic, with min and max length close to one another, info_cont3 unique values must be larger than 5, might be BOT NET possitive.
